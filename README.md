🏠 Indian House Price Prediction: A Machine Learning Analysis
This project presents a robust, end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to predict residential property prices across India. We leverage a detailed dataset of housing attributes to understand market dynamics and develop a highly accurate predictive tool.

🎯 Key Objectives
Data Analysis: Perform rigorous data cleaning, preparation, and feature engineering.

Model Comparison: Compare the performance of Linear Regression (baseline) and Random Forest Regressor (ensemble method).

Accuracy: Achieve a highly accurate model for real-world price estimation.

📈 Model Performance Highlights
To find the optimal solution, two distinct regression models were trained. The final results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the ensemble approach:

Top Model: The Random Forest Regressor

Performance: Achieved a strong R2 score of 0.8839, significantly outperforming the Linear Regression baseline (R2: 0.7015).

Error: Delivered the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE), validating its ability to handle the complex, non-linear factors that drive property value.
